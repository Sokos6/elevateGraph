set up our Node.js server with Express.js and bound Apollo Server to respond to requests on a GraphQL endpoint. We are able to handle queries, return fake data, and mutate that data with GraphQL mutations.

Furthermore, we can log every process in our Node.js server. Debugging an application with Postman leads to a well-tested API, which can be used later in our front end.
